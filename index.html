      <h1>About me:</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Ebba Celor and I'm 19 years old. I live and grew up in Sweden
        I chose to study New Media Design (NMD) since I like to be creative and
        like to draw on my spare time. I've alwaysed liked to draw and it has
        been my favorit subject since I was little, therefore NMD seemed to be a
        good option, even if it has a lot of courses that doesn't include
        drawing. Besides studying I also work part time at Postnord, when I have
        the time.
      </p>

      <p>
        On my spare time I like to draw, read, listen to music/podcasts, watch
        movies/series, play videogames and hang out with friends. I used to play
        tennis before, but not anymore. But among my favorit sports tennis is
        still one of my favorits and don't mind playing it from time to time. My
        favorit genre of books and series/movies is usually fantasy. But I like
        almost every genre although I'm not a big fan of horror or fact based
        information (unless it is something I'm interested in).
      </p>

      <p>
        My favorit types of videogames are games that focuses on the story it
        wants to tell, the choices you can make as a player and depending on
        them how the story ends. Games like that feel like you're watching a
        movie, but you're actually playing a game, that's something I really
        like. I also like to come up with stories and I hope to one day make
        them into either movies/series, books or story based video games.
