      <h2>About me:</h2>

      <p>
        My name is Ebba Celor and I'm 19 years old. I live and have grown up in
        <br />
        Sweden. I'm currently studying New Media Design (NMD) in Jönköping
        <br />
        University (JU). The reason I started to study NMD is because I like to
        be <br />
        creative and like to draw on my spare time. I have liked to draw for as
        long <br />
        as I can remember and it has been my favorit subject since I was little,
        <br />
        therefore NMD seemed to be a good option, even if it has a lot of
        courses <br />
        that doesn't include drawing. Besides studying I also work part time at
        Postnord, <br />
        when I have the time.
      </p>

      <p>
        On my spare time I like to draw, read, listen to music/podcasts, <br />
        watch movies/series, play videogames and hang out with friends. <br />
        I'm not currently playing any sport but I used to play tennis before,
        but not anymore. <br />
        Among my favorit sports tennis is still one of my favorits and don't
        mind playing it <br />
        from time to time.
