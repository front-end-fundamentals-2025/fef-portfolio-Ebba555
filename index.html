      <h2>About me:</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Ebba Celor and I'm 19 years old (20 in February). I live and
        grew up in Sweden. I'm currently studying New Media Design (NMD) in
        Jönköping University (JU). The reason I started to study NMD is because
        I like to be creative and like to draw on my spare time. I've alwaysed
        liked to draw and it has been my favorit subject since I was little,
        therefore NMD seemed to be a good option, even if it has a lot of
        courses that doesn't include drawing. Besides studying I also work part
        time at Postnord, when I have the time.
      </p>

      <p>
        On my spare time I like to draw, read, listen to music/podcasts, watch
        movies/series, play videogames and hang out with friends. I used to play
        tennis before, but not anymore. But among my favorit sports tennis is
        still one of my favorits and don't mind playing it from time to time. My
        favorit genre of books and series/movies is usually fantasy. But I like
        almost every genre although I'm not a big fan of horror or fact based
        information (unless it is something I'm interested in).
