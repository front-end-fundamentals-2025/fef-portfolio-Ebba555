      <h2>About me:</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Ebba Celor and I'm 19 years old (20 in February). I live and
        grew up in Sweden. I chose to study New Media Design (NMD) since I like
        to be creative and like to draw on my spare time. I've alwaysed liked to
        draw and it has been my favorit subject since I was little, therefore
        NMD seemed to be a good option, even if it has a lot of courses that
        doesn't include drawing. Besides studying I also work part time at
        Postnord, when I have the time.
      </p>

      <p>
        On my spare time I like to draw, read, listen to music/podcasts, watch
        movies/series, play videogames and hang out with friends. I used to play
        tennis before, but not anymore. But among my favorit sports tennis is
        still one of my favorits and don't mind playing it from time to time. My
        favorit genre of books and series/movies is usually fantasy. But I like
        almost every genre although I'm not a big fan of horror or fact based
        information (unless it is something I'm interested in).
